# Learning in Public 🎓

Resources, tools and tips from my experience while learning in public to become a fullstack web programmer and game developer.

### 📖 **What is learning in public?**

It simply means sharing our journey with other people, that which we are working on. It can be a career, a hobby, a new skill, whatever you're learning.

### 🚀 **Why learn in public?**

Because we learn faster. When we share our knowledge and our journey we get to connect with others who think like us, we build a community of people who give you feedback and share their knowledge or experience. We also help others who are on the same path and don't know which direction to take.

It's like a big study group where we support each other, sometimes you get feedback, learning and ideas and sometimes you are the one who teaches others something they want to learn.

And along the way you will meet amazing people who share your passion and will motivate you to keep improving.

### 👨‍🏫 **How to learn in public?**

It's very simple:
```
1. Choose a topic.
2. Learn. 
3. Share
```
For example, you can tweet new concepts or tools you have learned about the topic you are studying, write a blog showing your progress, create a youtube channel to talk about the topic, etc.

You can use any way that makes you feel comfortable sharing your experiences.
